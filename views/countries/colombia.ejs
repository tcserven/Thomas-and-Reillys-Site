				Colombia may not have Machu Picchu or the Galapagos, but we loved every city we visited here. If we could return to one of the countries that we visited and stay for an extended period of time it would undoubtedly be Colombia. The people, weather, food and vast terrain are unbeatable.

				<p>
					We took a bus from Quito to the bus station near the border and taxi to the border and then crossed the border on foot and grabbed a cab on the Colombia side to the other bus station in Ipiales to Popayan. After a couple nights in Popayan we went to Cali. From Cali we took a bus to Salento where we spent 3 nights at an eco lodge and then jumped in a mini-bus to Medellin. 
				</p>
				<p>
					From Medellin we took a 1.5 hour flight up to Santa Marta, the bus would have taken the better part of a day. We then went to a small town called Minca and then ended our trip with 5 amazing days in Cartagena.

		<p class="page-design__our-experience">
			<span>The Good</span>
			<ul class="page-design__our-experience--list">
				<li><strong>The people, the food, the vibe.</strong> For the amount of hardship this country has gone through in their recent history, they are lovely, happy people. I would live here if I could. Do not let the stories scare you from discovering this amazing country.</li>
				<li><strong>The prices are right.</strong> With the exception of Cartagena, Colombia is extremely affordable while at the same time getting great value for your money. Colombia is a mini-heaven for backpackers. </li>  
				<li>It is not yet booming with tourism. There has been a noticeable increase in the last few years, but you still feel like <strong>you are experiencing authentic Colombia. </strong></li>    
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="page-design__our-experience">
			<span>The Bad</span>
			<ul class="page-design__our-experience--list">
				<li>Not much. The main issue is that crime may be more potent in some areas vs other countries, but this should not be a deal breaker for you. Simply be a bit more careful with your belongings and the neighbourhoods you enter and you'll be completely fine. </li> 
			</ul>

			<span>The Verdict</span>
			<p class="section-headers__line-highlight section-headers__line-highlight--smaller">
				If we could pick one country to visit a second time, it would be Colombia. We absolutely loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone who is able to visit. There is also a variety of landscapes to visit from the Amazon to snow-capped mountains and beaches, there’s something for everyone. Plan to spend an extended period of time in Colombia.

				<li>
					<strong>Pablo Escobar -</strong> you may think that Escobar is very interesting and find that you want to ask a lot of questions about it. You need to remember that Escobar was killed in 1993, which means that most of these Colombians lived through the terror. Someone we met compared it to the Holocaust where that’s a part of Germany’s history. Here, they are still recovering from it and it is something they are trying to get over. Colombian have also been trying to create tourism and a good name for their amazing country. Please be aware that <strong>this is still fresh for them</strong> so do not walk around the streets speaking his name. One of our tour guides in Medellin pointed out that since most Colombians can’t speak English, they will just hear his name and not know what context you are speaking about him in and assume the worst. Just be conscious. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Although the security has risen in the last little while you need to <strong>be extra careful in Colombia</strong>, especially big cities like Medellin. We heard stories of large groups of people getting mugged at 7pm outside their hostel. Best advice is to only bring what you need with you and just comply with the demands of any muggers. 
				</li> 
				<li>
					You'll see lots of cigarette and candy vendors walking around. Hint: they sell MUCH more than candy and cigarettes.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong> When to Visit - always!</strong> But try and avoid tourist season which is December to February where the prices will be higher. 
				</li> 
				<li>
					<strong> Take flights between cities that are far apart -</strong> The flights are very cheap in Colombia! The main airline used in Colombia is called VivaColombia, and they are both affordable and offer great service. We original were going to take a bus from Medellin to Santa Marta but quickly changed our minds. The bus would have taken at least 16 hours and goes through a potentially dangerous windy path for ~20 CAD. The flight is 1h 10min for 50 CAD. Completely worth it. We wish AirCanada had the same values...

						<strong>&The Lost City Trek&</strong> trek to an ancient site dating back BEFORE Machu Picchu. Considered to be a close second to the MP trek minus the enormous tourist population. We would have loved to do this trek, but we didn’t have enough time at the end of our trip. We heard amazing things, but be aware that you will be sweaty!
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>&San Agustin&</strong> the archeological park here is the main draw, but there is much more to discover in San Agustin.
