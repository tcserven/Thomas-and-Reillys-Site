				Coming out of school, we did not have a lot of money to spend on travelling. We knew we wanted to do something significant, but didn’t have the funds to travel Europe or Australia for more than a month. &Machu Picchu& and the &Galapagos& were always on the top of our bucket list so we began our research on Peru, Ecuador and surrounding countries. We landed on Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia because it met our main criteria: there were amazing mountains, beaches, wildlife and culture they are cheap and all in a row. You can get some cheap flights in South America, but the bus is your most economical form of transportation. Choosing countries in a row is just logical and enabled us to stretch our money out over 3 months without compromising much. Check out our &Budget Blog& for a breakdown of our costs for our trip.

		We did research and chose this route for many reasons. Originally our route went from Chile to Colombia, ending in Medellin. We ended up cutting out Chile because of how expensive it can be and extending up to Cartagena, Colombia.

		We chose to begin our trip in Bolivia mainly because of the prices of flights, they are pretty cheap from Canada to Bolivia. We landed in &La Paz& after a nightmare flight with 2 layovers, including one in Lima that was over 20 hours. We did this for the savings, but looking back we may have spent the extra couple hundred to get a better flight. Something you will need to factor in if you are planning to start your trip in La Paz is the altitude. I cannot stress enough how badly you can be affected by this. Read our blog on &La Paz& for more information on how to avoid or lessen the affects of the altitude. We also did not factor in the weather; Bolivia was cold when we got there as it was their winter. Also, Bolivia is much less touristy than the other countries we visited, which means less English speaking people. Overall, we are glad we started in Bolivia, but we wish we would have been more prepared for it. Check out our &Bolivia Blog& for a more in-depth look at Bolivia and all the cities we visited.

		Our route was mainly mountains and coast. We did not go into the Amazon at all, we intend for that to be a trip all on it’s own in the future. Again, we chose this for economical reason, we didn’t want to be spread too thin. We wanted to do what we were doing right. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Originally the plan was to end in Medellin, Colombia, but halfway into our trip we made the decision to cut out most of Ecuador and do more of Colombia. We did this because of the feedback we were getting from other travellers coming from North to South. I think you will find the same, Colombia is amazing and you will want to spend as much time there as you can manage.

		To be honest, we chose a route and general guideline of what we wanted to do and see, but much of that changed as we went along. We would recommend you do the same; allow yourself wiggle-room to modify your plans as you see fit. Check out our &Guideline to planning your trip& blog to get some quick tips.
